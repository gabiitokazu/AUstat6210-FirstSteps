# Exercise 1

## Introduction

[//]: # (to install and load emoji package)

```{r emo_install, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

if (!require("emo")) {
  devtools::install_github(("hadley/emo"))
  library(emo)
}

```

### Ana Gabriela Itokazu `` `r emo::ji("speech_balloon")` ``

[//]: # (defining parameters for the block, image, giphy, and table environments for customized alignment and size)

 ```{css, echo=FALSE}
 
  .image {
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    width: 70%;
  }
  .image p {

I have been working around algae since the my Bachelor's second year. At first, I got tangled in the taxonomy and systematics *i.e.* why we name each algae the way we do, and why that species is not another. Generally, it is a dreary task. We go over long keys, spend hours leaning on a microscope crossing eyes, only to get to the conclusion that "yep, not the same alga". But we do bump into some beauties. To make sure I had the right (or the wrong) one, I'd go over several books and keys, looking for images like the one in <a class="link" href="#cladophora">Figure 1</a>, for example.

Later on, I changed subjects to applied biotechnology, where I played around with toxicology, remediation, pollutant removal, and fell in love with ecological restoration. My undergraduate research advisor, Dr. Leonardo Rorig got a grant to prospect algal species for heavy metal removal. After I graduated, I got into the Biotechnology Graduate Program, and started researching with Algal Turf Scrubber Systems (ATS) for nutrient removal and restoration. ATS is a fairly simple system, with a screen placed on top of a flowlane to providing a physical substratum for algae to attach, and grow. Some people maintain similar systems as a hobby to keep the health of their aquaria at home (see the video by the end of this section)! The goal species vary from filamentous to leafy-like algae, and the optimum for my setup were filamentous macroalgae species, such as *Ulva intestinalis* (see <a class="link" href="#alguinha">Figure 2</a>). We got to study the succession of algae communities, all the way from an algal-bacterial biofilm, to dense turf-like mats of filamentous algae.

During the Latin-American Congress on Sea Sciences (2017) that I had the honor to help organize, Dr. David Blersch went to Brazil to give a talk and contribute in one of the panel sessions. There, we had the opportunity show him the research we were doing and talk about a possible position as research assistant at Auburn University. We coordinated, and I applied for the Ph.D. program in Biosystems Engineering - which was scary because I'm no engineer, but then I got accepted and I was like

For the first couple semesters here, I had to take engineering core courses, such as calculus, thermodynamics, and mechanics of materials, but now my life looks like the table below, and it is pretty nice indeed.

### Harsha Galkanda-Arachchige (*under construction*)

#### - Origin

I'm Harsha from Sri Lanka, the country call as the "pearl of the Indian Ocean" `r emo::ji("star_struck")`.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.cap="You should visit one day"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/harrs/Documents/GitHub/srilanka.jpg")
```


![You should visit one day](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlODSi2o73UNNN6/giphy.gif)


#### - Education

I'm researching on **aquaculture** which is the industry expanding rapidly over the past decade exceeding the annual growth rates of poultry, pork, dairy and beef industries to provide animal protein to the world `r emo::ji("grinning")`. 


![**Its not only about your hunger, but also about your health and survival**](https://media.giphy.com/media/3orif3WTpZFYRhdLMs/giphy.gif)


According [@tacon2020trends], 
>"total global aquaculture production now exceeds the global capture fisheries production by over 18.32 million tonnes>

This emphasize the importance of aquaculture research to improve its efficiency for further `r emo::ji("stars")`.
